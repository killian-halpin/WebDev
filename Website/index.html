        <h1> About Cahir GAA</h1>
        <p> Cahir GAA was founded in 1885. It is a club in the South of Tipperary abpout twenty minutes away from Thurles. It's nickname is the slashers. The Colours of the club are green and white. Cahir wouldn't have a big pick of players with all the surrounding towns and villages having their own clubs so it is largely locally run. We are a dual Club. We field Junior hurling teams and a Senior Football team. Our only success to date was winning the 2003 Senior County Championship.</p>
